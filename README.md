# EDA-White-wine

The white wine has believed to be existed for at least 2500 years. The sommelier - an expert on wine taster learns and practices for many years to understand the qualities of wines. Artificial intelligence is an ideal area to explore and solve this problem. Here. I'll go through an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a simple Machine learning using Random Forest classifer on the white wine dataset. This dataset contains 11 physicochemical (some are physical and others are chemical properties) properties and a quality of the wine, which is a sensor data from the sommelier.
