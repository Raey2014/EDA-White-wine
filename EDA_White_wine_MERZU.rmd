> **Introduction**: White wine has believed to be existed for at least 2500 
years. The sommelier - an expert on wine taster learns and practices for many 
years to understand the qualities of wines. Artificial intelligence is an ideal 
area to explore and solve this problem. Here. I'll go through an exploratory 
data analysis (EDA) and a simple Machine learning using random forest on the 
white wine dataset. This dataset contains 11 physicochemical (some are physical
and others are chemical properties) properties and a quality of the wine, which
is a sensor data from the sommelier.

White_wine <- read.csv('wineQualityWhites.csv', sep=',',
                       encoding = "UTF-8")

head(White_wine,2)
```

> **Short data Summary and descriptions**: The white wine dataset contains close
to 5000 observations with 12 physicochemical properties and one observation ID.
The target variable in this EDA is the sensor data wine quality. The median 
wine qualities is 6 with mean value 5.878. Moreover, the distribution of wine 
quality is nearly a normal centred on the median. Therefore, I will create a 
categorical variable, rate, with a low below the median, high above the median 
and medium with median value.

### Lets look a descriptive statistics of the dataset

#### Dimension of the dataset
```{r echo=FALSE, Summary1}
str(White_wine)
```

#### Column names
```{r echo=FALSE, Summary2}

names(White_wine)
```

#### Descriptive statistics
```{r echo=FALSE, Summary3}

summary(White_wine)
```

## White Wine Attributes Information

#### Input variables (based on physicochemical tests) & attributes description:
1. Fixed acidity (mostly tartaric acid - g / dm^3): imparting sourness and 
resistance to microbial infection.

2. Volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3): gives vinegar its characteristic 
flavour and aroma.

3. Citric acid (g / dm^3): found in small quantities, citric acid can add 
‘freshness’ and flavour to wines

4. Residual sugar (g / dm^3): the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation 
stops.

5. Chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3): the amount of salt in the wine.

6. Free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3): the free form of SO2 exists which prevents 
microbial growth and the oxidation of wine.

7. Total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3):  the amount of free and bound forms of SO2.

8. Density (g / cm^3): the density of the wine.

9. pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from <7 
(acid range ) to >7 (base range) and 7 neutral. Wines are mostly acidic.

10. Sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm^3): which prevents microbial 
spoilage and fight oxygenation.

11. Alcohol (% by volume): the percent alcohol content of the wine

12. Quality: A sensor data from a sommelier with (0 to 10).

# Univariate Plots Section
Lets plot the distribution of white wine quality. The red dashed line is the 
mean of the quality of wine. Majority of the wine qualites are of rating 6, very
few are rating 3 and 9.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots,fig.height=4, fig.width=8}

ggplot(aes(x=quality), data = White_wine) + geom_histogram(bins = 20) + 
  ggtitle("White wine quality count") + 
scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(3,9,1)) + 
geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(White_wine$quality)), colour="red",linetype=2)+
coord_flip() 
```

Let us group the wine quality to low (quality < 6), medium (quality = 6) and 
high (quality > 6). Now the distribution of wines rating is comparable and a 
simple classifier with these categories can work reasonably well.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_rating,fig.height=4, fig.width=8}

White_wine$rate <- ifelse(White_wine$quality>6, 'High', 
                          ifelse(White_wine$quality==6, 'Medium', 'Low'))

White_wine$rate <- factor(White_wine$rate, levels=c('Low','Medium','High'))

White_wine$bound_sulfur.dioxide <- White_wine$total.sulfur.dioxide - 
  White_wine$free.sulfur.dioxide

White_wine %>% filter(!is.na(rate)) %>% group_by(rate) %>% count() %>% 
ungroup() %>% 
ggplot(aes(reorder(rate, n), y = n/dim(White_wine)[1], fill = n)) +
geom_bar(stat = "identity") + xlab("Wine rating") + ylab("Frequency") +
coord_flip() +
theme(legend.position ='none', axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10)) + 
geom_text(aes(label = n), hjust = -0.01, size = 2.50) +
scale_fill_gradientn(name = '',colours = rev(brewer.pal(3,"Accent"))) +  
ggtitle("White wine rating (count)") + theme_bw() + guides(fill=FALSE)
```

Let us explore the distribution of each feature variables using a histogram. 
Most of the variables follow nearly a Gaussian distribution. Alcohol has high
observations at low alcohol and citric acid has high observation around 0.495. 
However, residual sugar after log transformation, it follows bimodal 
distribution.

```{r echo=FALSE, Uni_distributions, fig.height=16, fig.width=16}

# Univariate Analysis

### What is the structure of your dataset?
The white wine dataset contains 11 variables, one ID and one a sensor variable 
with 4898 observations. Some of them are chemical and others are physical 
properties of a wine.
### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?
In this EDA, wine quality is target variable while others like alcohol, density
, residual sugars are important variables for that correlate with the wine 
quality.
### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your \
investigation into your feature(s) of interest?

I think all the other variables are also important because the wine quality is 
not completely described by the few features. That means that the wine quality 
does not have a strong correlation with any of the other variables. In fact, 
machine learning may predict wine quality with very low accuracy and more 
features may require to accurately predict the wine quality.

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?
Yes, I created (i) rate variable that classifies wines quality to low, medium 
and high categories, and (ii) bound sulfur dioxide that is the difference 
between the total and free sulfur dioxide.

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? \
Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form \
of the data? If so, why did you do this?

Most of the features have a normal distribution with a few outliers to the right
. However, residual sugar after log transformation is a bimodal distribution.
Citric acid distribution also follows with a normal distribution, but at 0.5 
there is a high observation that deviates the normal curve fitted on it. This 
dataset is tidy but I think it is not enough to completely describe/predict the
quality of wine with a high degree of accuracy unless it is bucketed with a few
classes. The distribution of the wine quality is not uniform, very few with 
high quality as well very few with low quality. Any machine learning will 
struggle to correctly predict those outlier wine qualities. 

# Bivariate Plots Section

Below I used correlation matrix to visualize the pair-wise relationship between
two variables and will guide us which variables to look deeper. Alcohol has the
highest positive correlation with the quality of the wine and density has the 
highest anti-correlation with quality of a wine. 

```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots_cor, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, dpi=70}
cols <- c('fixed.acidity','volatile.acidity','citric.acid','residual.sugar',
          'chlorides','free.sulfur.dioxide',
          'total.sulfur.dioxide','density','pH','sulphates','alcohol',
          'bound_sulfur.dioxide','quality')
ggcorrplot(round(cor(White_wine[cols]), 1), hc.order = TRUE, type = "lower",
           lab = TRUE)
```

let us look deeper into the relationship between two variables using scatter 
plots.  As shown in the figure below, the wine quality has a positive 
correlation with alcohol and pH, but it has also a negative correlation with 
density, chlorides total sulfur dioxide. However, it has little or no 
relationship with citric acid. Alcohol also has a negative correlation with 
density and total sulfur dioxide. Density and residual sugar have a positive 
correlation with higher residual sugar.

# Bivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the \
investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in 
the dataset?

Without converting the quality of wine to a few buckets, the quality of a wine 
is weakly correlated with pH and sulphates and negatively correlated with all 
variables except citric acid and free sulphates dioxide with no correlation for
those variables. But after, bucket the wine quality into low, medium and high 
based the quality scores with low less than 6, medium with quality 6 and high 
above 6, it is clear that wine quality is positively correlated with alcohol, 
and negatively correlated with density.

### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features \
### (not the main feature(s) of interest)?

The density of wine is positively correlated with residual sugar 
(not surprising since residual sugars (mostly solid) have a higher density) 
but it is also negatively correlated with the alcohol content of the wine.

### What was the strongest relationship you found?

Density with alcohol and density with residual sugar has a higher correlation.

# Multivariate Plots Section

Let us dive into three or more variables in one figure with scatter and box 
plots. Again it is apparent that the quality of a wine is directly correlated 
with alcohol and sulphate. However, it is negatively correlated with density, 
residual sugar and chlorides. Here the box plot also shows that citric acid has
little negative correlation with quality of a wine. 

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots, fig.height=12, fig.width=18}

    xlim=c(quantile(White_wine$density,.01),quantile(White_wine$density,.99)),

        ) 

grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6, ncol=3)
```

Diving into more relationship with a scatter plots adding smoothing. Quality of 
a wine has a negative relationship with density, chlorides and residual sugar. 
It also shows that the density and residual sugar has a linear relationship at 
higher residual sugar. Similarly, density has a linear relationship at higher 
alcohol contents of the wine. pH has a negative correlation with fixed acidity 
(not surprising that higher pH are bases than acid).

# Multivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the 
### investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of 
### looking at your feature(s) of interest?

High density, high residual sugar and high citric acid are the quality of a 
low rated wine. High alcohol, low density and low fixed acidity are the quality
of a highly rated wine. Many variables also have very weak but positive 
correlation.

### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?

I think most of the correlations I observed are what I expected. However, the 
density of highly rated wines is less than one (less than water at room 
temperature). I know we don't like to drink a wine that is too heavy in our 
mouth but that is a surprise for me. What if we can reduce the density of the 
wine with half of the water and will that be still a good wine? Maybe or it may
not go down through our oesophagus? 

# Modeling with random forest classifier
Let us use a random forest regressor to classify the wines quality in the 
three class.

```{r echo=FALSE, Random_Forest_model}

set.seed(123)

cols <- c('fixed.acidity','volatile.acidity','citric.acid','residual.sugar',
          'chlorides','free.sulfur.dioxide',
          'total.sulfur.dioxide','density','pH','sulphates','alcohol',
          'bound_sulfur.dioxide','rate')

wine <- White_wine[, cols]

samp <- sample(nrow(wine), 0.7 * nrow(wine))

train <- wine[samp, ]

test <- wine[-samp, ]

model <-  randomForest(rate ~ ., data=train, importance=TRUE, do.trace=100)

### OPTIONAL: Did you create any models with your dataset? Discuss the \
### strengths and limitations of your model.

I created a random forest regressor that classifies the wine qualities into 
three groups (low, medium or high) with an out-of-bag (OOB) of 28.27%. OOB is a 
method of measuring the prediction error of random forests. This model is 
powerful toclassify in those quality types. However, if we use the model on the 
original dataset, the OOB surely increases. Any model will struggle to predict 
the lower and higher qualities of the wine.

# Final Plots and Summary

### Plot One
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_One,fig.height=4, fig.width=8, dpi=70}

p1 <- ggplot(aes(x=pH), data = White_wine) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..),colour = "black", fill = "white", 
                 binwidth = 0.01) + 
    stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = mean(White_wine$pH), 
    sd = sd(White_wine$pH))) + ggtitle("pH: Nornal distribution") +
  ylab("kernal density values")

p2 <- ggplot(aes(x=residual.sugar), data = White_wine) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..),
      colour = "black", fill = "white", binwidth = 0.02) + scale_x_log10() +
  ggtitle("Residual sugar: Bimodal distribution") +
  xlab("log10(residual sugar (g/dm^3))") + ylab("kernal density values")

grid.arrange(p1,p2,ncol=2)
```

### Description One
Most of the feature variables have an almost normal distribution with a few 
outliers. The pH distributions are the one with a perfect uniform distribution,
while the residual sugar after log10 transformation it is a bimodal 
distribution.

### Plot Two
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_Two, fig.height=4, fig.width=8, dpi=70}

 ggplot(aes(x=density, y=residual.sugar, color=rate), data=White_wine) + 
    geom_point(alpha=1/1,size=2, position = position_jitter(h=0))  + 
    coord_cartesian(
    xlim=c(quantile(White_wine$density,.01),quantile(White_wine$density,.99)),
    ylim=c(quantile(White_wine$residual.sugar,.01),
           quantile(White_wine$residual.sugar,.99)) 
    )  + ggtitle("Density vs residual sugar with wine rating") + 
  xlab("Density (g/cm^3)") + ylab("Residual sugar (g/dm^3)")
```

### Description Two
Here I showed three variables in one plot: residual sugar as the function of 
density with a colour of wine rating. From this plot, residual sugar is not a 
strictly linear relationship. In fact, there are many ratings of low, medium 
and high with very low residual sugar with a continuous increasing density and
majority of this wines are low rating class. The other class of wines are where
residual sugar increases linearly with density, and the majority of this 
classes of wine are high rating with low density and low residual sugars.

### Plot Three

```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_Three,fig.height=4, fig.width=8, dpi=70}

ggplot(White_wine, aes(x=alcohol,y=density,colour=fixed.acidity)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha=1/1,size=4,position = position_jitter(h=0))+
scale_colour_gradient2(low="yellow", high="red") + 
facet_grid(~rate)  + 
coord_cartesian(
ylim=c(quantile(White_wine$density,.01),quantile(White_wine$density,.99))
) + geom_smooth(method = 'loess',colour="black")  +
  ggtitle("Alcohol vs density with fixed acidity, and facets by wine rating") +
  xlab("Alcohol (%)") + ylab("Density (g/cm^3)") 
```

### Description Three

In this last figure, there are four variables explored. The density of the 
function of alcohol colour by fixed acidity and facets with wine rating. First,
highest quality of a wine is with low acidity (light red colour) and low
density. Second, the density and alcohol are not linearly correlated especially
for low rating wine, most probably the correlation is a power law.

# Reflection

In this report, first, I explored the distribution of each variable with a 
histogram and fitting with a normal distribution. Second, I examined in detail
on the relationship between two variables using correlation table, scatter and
box plots.  Finally, three or more variable is studied in detail to give us
insight into the target variable, the wine quality. In the end, a simple random 
forest classifier was used to predict the wine qualities into three
categories. 

I convinced in this dataset, there is no strong predictor of the quality of the 
wine. In fact, simple linear models will predict very poorly.  Some of the 
variables are also not a simple linear relationship. For example, density with 
residual sugar is not a simple linear relationship for high rated wine. 

The white wine dataset is tidy. However, the dataset is skewed for wine quality
observations. There are very few high or low wine quality observations. 
This will be very difficult to train a machine learning to predict all qualities
of wine (3-9) accurately.
